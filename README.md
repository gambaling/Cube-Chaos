# Cube-Chaos
This is a 3D Unity-C# casual game that I'm developing as a study project.

My goals with this project are to help me build solid C#/Unity knowledge and experience,
while at the same time help others to achieves the very same,
thats why most methodes have more comments than a commercial standard code, 
so feel free to look the scripts if you found somithing that you want to understand.

I'm planning to publish for both windows, mac and mobile, but that's gonna take a while since first I wanna add:
*more levels;
*solid saving levels system;
*A E S T H E T I C S;
*an infinity mode with procedural generation;
